    <h2>Comupting will most definitly change society. It already has and it will continue to do so. The advancment of the computer 
    and the programs on it have completely changed how our world and society functions. The way in which information is exchanged has gone 
    from handing a piece of paper to someone to send a message to anyone in the world. It has created hundreds of different professions from 
    internet security to monitoring online bank transactions. One can only imagine where technology will take us from here: Anywhere from 
    flying cars to artificial intellegence. The more advanced computing gets, the more the world will adjust to satisfy it.</h2>
