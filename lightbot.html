    <h2>The lightbot is much closer to a computer than you might think. They both need an input to begin such as a mouse for a computer or an action for lightbot. Both of them react off of that input and respond 
    with an output such as moving or lighting a blue tile. Both also use state machines: recognizing a positon and moving or preforming an action in response to an input. In contrast they differ because the lightbot works on a much simpler
    and smaller scale than a computer. While  lightbot does one state action, the computer is doing many at once</h2>
