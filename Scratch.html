  <p>1. This is better because it is much easier to make a mistake than you might think. Checking code in small section ensures that you can find a mistake if you make one. <br> 2. Science experiments are quite similar, you have to 
  try many times most of the time because it didn't work the first. Coding is different though because in an experiment if it failed it probably meant that an assumtion was incorrect. <br> 4. A two core computer can run 10 programs at seemingly the same time because it can run one line from 
   one program then switch to the next program faster than our eyes can tell the difference.</p>

  <p>1. In larger projects, projecting a message to many sprites can slow down the program significantly.<br>2. An event is an action that can be triggered and a hadler is the function that deals with the event.<br>3a. Some details that
  are encapsulated by playG() is the noise it makes and how it changes the sprite. 3b. It might be usefull to show how the sprite changes because it can have an affect on the rest of the program.</p>
