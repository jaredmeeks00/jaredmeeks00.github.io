  <h2>1. This is better because it is much easier to make a mistake than you might think. Checking code in small section ensures that you can find a mistake if you make one. <br> 2. Science experiments are quite similar, you have to 
  try many times most of the time because it didn't work the first. Coding is different though because in an experiment if it failed it probably meant that an assumtion was incorrect <br> 3.
   Ibe lieve we worked together very well. Next time we could work better if we talked about our code more and what it did. <br> 4. A two core computer can run 10 programs at seemingly the same time because it can run one line from 
   one program then switch to the next program faster than our eyes can tell the difference.</h2>
